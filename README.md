Setup:
Copy the provided Python code into a Python (.py) file, for example, maze_generator.py.

Running the Code:

You can run the code using any Python environment or IDE.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the Python file.
Run the Python file using the command: python maze_generator.py.

Input:

The input to the generate_maze function is the desired number of rows and columns for the maze grid.

Output:

The output of the code is a 2D representation of the maze in the console.
Roads are represented by empty spaces, and walls are represented by '#'.

Explanation:

The code uses a simplified version of the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to generate the maze.
Each cell in the maze grid is represented by a Cell object with flags for road (is_road) and wall (is_wall).
The generate_maze function initializes the maze grid and iteratively carves passages between cells using DFS.
